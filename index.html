Your team ideally should have 2-3 co-founders, but we also consider groups of four or five. The best team has co-founders with multiple talents: development, business, design, marketing, etc.</p>

                          <p class="text-muted text-left">Peer learning and mentorship is a significant aspect of the development process. Teams will provide weekly updates to their cohort and program managers. This will also be an opportunity to ask for help and pose any questions that the teams may have. Peer mentorship will also be instituted to encourage residents to help each other critically assess their ideas and progress.

The evaluations will be used to provide the teams with regular and impartial feedback, as well as help the teams improve their presentation skills.

The teams will have access to the common space to work on their startup ideas to develop and refine their products and services. Additionally, lab space in the basement of the MB will be available for EPIC residents to use for the duration of their residency. Lastly, conference rooms will be available for the teams to reserve and use free of charge.

However, if significant AUA resources are used during the idea development and incubation stages, AUA may own the IP. However, to make the process transparent for all parties, EPIC management will communicate directly with the team if there are potential IP (co)owning / licensing prospects.
